Welcome to the **third chapter** of our **KubeBlocks** tutorial series!

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll focus on **backup & restore** â€” a crucial component of **Operator Capability Level 3**, which emphasizes **full lifecycle management** of databases on Kubernetes. Weâ€™ll now address why backups and restores are **vital for production environments**, how to create them with **minimal downtime**, and how to safely and quickly recover data when needed.

## Prerequisites

To save you time, weâ€™ve **automatically installed KubeBlocks** and created a **3-replica MySQL cluster** in the background. It may take a few minutes to complete the setupâ€”feel free to proceed, but keep in mind that some commands might need to wait until the installation is fully finished.

If youâ€™re new to KubeBlocks or missed the previous tutorials, see:
- [KubeBlocks Tutorial 101 â€“ Getting Started](/tutorials/kubeblocks-101-99db8bca)
- [KubeBlocks Tutorial 201 - Seamless Upgrades](/tutorials/kubeblocks-201-83b9a997)

## 1. Introduction

In this lab environment, you should already have:
- **KubeBlocks** installed.
- A **3-replica MySQL cluster** named `mycluster` in the `demo` namespace.

Verify that the cluster is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo
```

You should see something like:

```
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mycluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   0          2m
mycluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running   0          2m
mycluster-mysql-2   4/4     Running   0          2m
```

This same cluster will be used to demonstrate **backup & restore** features.

**Optional: Add Sample Data**  
Before proceeding, you may want to **connect to your MySQL cluster** and create some test data. For example:

```bash
kbcli cluster connect mycluster -n demo
```

Once connected, create your own database, tables, and sample records (e.g., `CREATE DATABASE test;`, `CREATE TABLE test.mytable ...;`, `INSERT INTO test.mytable ...;`) so that you can confirm the backup and restore processes successfully carry over any data you create.

Below is a **simplified** version of the *Backup Basics* section, emphasizing the **key points** while maintaining clarity and readability:

## 2. Backup Basics

KubeBlocks provides **comprehensive backup and restore capabilities** to protect your database data. All backups require a **BackupRepo**, where backup artifacts are storedâ€”this can be **object storage** or **PVC-based** volumes.

Under the hood, KubeBlocks supports **physical backup tools** (like XtraBackup for MySQL) and **volume snapshots**, giving you the flexibility to choose the method that best fits your workload. You can perform **on-demand** backups for immediate data protection or set up **scheduled** backups to automatically capture and manage your data over time.

### 2.1 Supported Backup Storage

- **Object Storage**: S3, GCS, OSS, COS, or MinIO (S3-compatible).
- **PVC-based Storage**: Uses Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims.

In **KubeBlocks**, you may have multiple **BackupRepos** for different environments or regions. For this tutorial, a **default** repository has already been created. To verify it:

```bash
kubectl get backuprepo -n demo
```

::details-box
---
:summary: You should be able to see output like this
---
```bash
NAME         STATUS   STORAGEPROVIDER   ACCESSMETHOD   DEFAULT   AGE
backuprepo   Ready    pvc               Mount          true      45m
```
::

## 3. Creating a Backup

### 3.1 Backup Methods

**KubeBlocks** supports a variety of backup methods, which may differ based on the database engine and the underlying storage. In general:

- **Physical backup** (e.g., `xtrabackup`) captures the actual data files on disk.
- **Volume snapshot** leverages cloud-native snapshot capabilities of the storage layer.

The approach you choose can vary depending on your **database engine**, **storage provider**, and **performance requirements**. For MySQL, two common methods are:

- **xtrabackup**: Uses the Percona XtraBackup tool for online backups.
- **volume-snapshot**: Uses Kubernetes volume snapshot functionality if supported by your storage.

To see which backup methods are available for `mycluster`:

```bash
kbcli cluster describe-backup-policy mycluster -n demo
```

::details-box
---
:summary: You should be able to see output like this
---
```bash
Summary:
Name:               mycluster-mysql-backup-policy
Cluster:            mycluster
Namespace:          demo
Default:            true

Backup Methods:
NAME              ACTIONSET              SNAPSHOT-VOLUMES
xtrabackup        mysql-xtrabackup       false
volume-snapshot   mysql-volumesnapshot   true
```
::

### 3.2 Create a Backup

Below is a **minimal** example of creating a backup via YAML. Weâ€™ll use **xtrabackup** here:

1. **Define the Backup Resource**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<-'EOF'
apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: mybackup
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backupMethod: xtrabackup
  backupPolicyName: mycluster-mysql-backup-policy
EOF
```

- `backupMethod: xtrabackup` indicates weâ€™re using the **xtrabackup** tool.
- `backupPolicyName: mycluster-mysql-backup-policy` references the default MySQL backup policy.

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_trigger_backup
---
#active
Confirming the backup was triggered...

#completed
Great! The backup was triggered successfully.
::

2. **Verify the Backup**:

After applying the resource, you can:

```bash
kubectl get backup -n demo
```

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_backup_progress
---
#active
Checking backup progress...

#completed
Great! The backup has completed successfully.
::

Wait for the STATUS to become `Completed` (It may take about a minute).

```bash
NAME       POLICY                          METHOD       REPO         STATUS      TOTAL-SIZE   DURATION   CREATION-TIME          COMPLETION-TIME        EXPIRATION-TIME
mybackup   mycluster-mysql-backup-policy   xtrabackup   backuprepo   Completed   1587198      55s        2025-01-21T10:03:35Z   2025-01-21T10:04:30Z
```

Here, `TOTAL-SIZE` shows the size of the backup, and `DURATION` indicates how long the backup process took.

You can also check details:

```bash
kubectl describe backup mybackup -n demo
```

The backup artifact now resides in the configured **BackupRepo** (e.g., S3, MinIO, or a PVC).

---

## 4. Restoring from a Backup

### 4.1 Restore Workflow Overview

**KubeBlocks** supports creating a **new cluster** from an existing backup, allowing you to spin up a cloned environment. Under the hood, the operator retrieves the backup data from the specified **BackupRepo** and re-seeds the target MySQL cluster.

### 4.2 Executing the Restore

1. **Restore the Backup**:

```bash
kbcli cluster restore myrestore --backup mybackup -n demo
```

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_restore_trigger
---
#active
Confirming the restore cluster was created...

#completed
Great! The restore cluster was created successfully.
::

::details-box
---
:summary: How to Restore data from backup using YAML
---
The `kbcli` command above is a convenience wrapper that ultimately applies YAML behind the scenes. For instance:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<-'EOF'
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: myrestore
  namespace: demo
  annotations:
    kubeblocks.io/restore-from-backup: '{"mysql":{"name":"mybackup","namespace":"demo","connectionPassword":"Bw1cR15mzfldc9hzGuK4m1BZQOzha6aBb1i9nlvoBdoE9to4"}}'
spec:
  clusterDefinitionRef: apecloud-mysql
  clusterVersionRef: ac-mysql-8.0.30
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
  componentSpecs:
    - name: mysql
      componentDefRef: mysql
      replicas: 3
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
EOF
```

Here, the annotation `kubeblocks.io/restore-from-backup` references the backup to use and the necessary credentials for restoration.
::

2. **Monitor the Restore Process**:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo
```

Youâ€™ll see new Pods (e.g., `myrestore-mysql-0`, etc.) come online and begin synchronization.

3. **Validate the New/Recovered Cluster**:

- Ensure each Pod transitions to `Running`.
- Confirm that you can connect and that the data is correct:

```bash
kbcli cluster connect myrestore -n demo
```

Check whether any test databases or tables you created earlier are present in this new cluster, confirming that your backup and restore processes worked successfully.

---

## Summary

We have demonstrated how KubeBlocks supports **backup & restore** â€” a key feature at **Operator Capability Level 3**. These capabilities ensure **data integrity**, **disaster recovery**, and **production-grade** operations for your MySQL workloads on Kubernetes.
