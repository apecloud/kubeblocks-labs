Welcome to the **third chapter** of our **KubeBlocks** tutorial series!

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll focus on **backup & restore** â€” a crucial component of **Operator Capability Level 3**, which emphasizes **full lifecycle management** of databases on Kubernetes. Weâ€™ll now address why backups and restores are **vital for production environments**, how to create them with **minimal downtime**, and how to safely and quickly recover data when needed.

## Prerequisites

To save you time, weâ€™ve **automatically installed KubeBlocks** and created a **3-replica MySQL cluster** in the background. It may take a few minutes to complete the setupâ€”feel free to proceed, but keep in mind that some commands might need to wait until the installation is fully finished.

If youâ€™re new to KubeBlocks or missed the previous tutorials, see:
- [KubeBlocks Tutorial 101 â€“ Getting Started](/tutorials/kubeblocks-101-99db8bca) 
- [KubeBlocks Tutorial 201 - Seamless Upgrades](/tutorials/kubeblocks-201-83b9a997)

## 1. Introduction & Recap

### 1.1 Operator Capability Level 3

- **Operator Capability Level 3** moves beyond basic installation and upgrade tasks to include **day-2 operations** such as **backups, restores, and failovers**.
- In our [Tutorial 201](#), we demonstrated **seamless upgrades** of a MySQL cluster with minimal impact on applications.
- Now, weâ€™ll explore **backups and restores**, which are critical for:
    - **Disaster recovery**: Safeguard against unexpected data loss.
    - **Environment cloning**: Quickly spin up test or dev environments from production data.
    - **Data archiving**: Keep historical snapshots of your database state.

### 1.2 Reviewing Current Cluster

In this lab environment, you should already have:
- **KubeBlocks** installed.
- A **3-replica MySQL cluster** named `mycluster` in the `demo` namespace.

Verify that the cluster is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo
```

You should see something like:

```
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mycluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   0          2m
mycluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running   0          2m
mycluster-mysql-2   4/4     Running   0          2m
```

This same cluster will be used to demonstrate **backup & restore** features.

## 2. Backup Basics

### 2.1 Why Backup & Restore Matter

Most production databases **require robust backup strategies** for:

1. **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: In cases of hardware failures, software bugs, or accidental deletions.
2. **Environment Cloning**: Quickly replicate production data for development or QA.
3. **Data Archiving**: Retain snapshots for compliance or historical analysis.

**KubeBlocks** leverages operator intelligence to handle backups in an **application-aware** manner, ensuring **transaction consistency** and **seamless orchestration** with Kubernetes.

### 2.2 Supported Backup Types & Storage

1. **Full vs. Incremental**: Depending on your storage and database engine, you may configure different backup strategies (incremental backup is engine-dependent and might not always be supported).
2. **Storage Configurations**:
    - **Object storage** such as S3, GCS, OSS, COS, or MinIO (S3-compatible).
    - **PVC-based storage** on Kubernetes.
3. **Backup CRDs / Custom Resources**:
    - **BackupRepo**: A Custom Resource that defines the storage repository for backups.
    - **Backup**: A Custom Resource that defines when and how backups are taken.
    - **OpsRequest** (type=Backup) in certain cases, or **Backup** CR under `dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1`.

In **KubeBlocks**, you can create multiple **BackupRepos** to suit different scenarios (e.g., separate object storage for different lines of business or multi-region redundancy). For simplicity, **a default backup repository** has already been created in this tutorial environment.

To verify the existing BackupRepo:

```bash
kubectl get backuprepo -n demo
```

---

## 3. Creating a Backup

### 3.1 Backup Workflow Overview

When you trigger a backup in **KubeBlocks**:

1. The operator looks at the **Backup** (or **OpsRequest**) resource.
2. It checks which **BackupRepo** is specified (or defaults to the configured one).
3. It **orchestrates** the backup process, ensuring minimal disruption to the running MySQL cluster.
4. The resulting **backup artifact** is stored in the designated repository (e.g., an S3 bucket or a PVC).

**KubeBlocks** provides different backup methods for different databases. In MySQL, for instance, you might use:
- **xtrabackup** (physical backup tool).
- **volume-snapshot** (utilizing cloud-native volume snapshots).

To see which backup methods are available for `mycluster`:

```bash
kbcli cluster list-backup-policy mycluster -n demo
```

Then describe the default policy:

```bash
kbcli cluster describe-backup-policy mycluster -n demo
```

You will typically see two methods for MySQL:
- **xtrabackup**: backups to object storage.
- **volume-snapshot**: leverages volume snapshot capabilities.

### 3.2 Step-by-Step Backup Creation

Below is a **minimal** example of creating a backup via YAML. Weâ€™ll use **xtrabackup** here:

1. **Define the Backup Resource**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<-'EOF'
   apiVersion: dataprotection.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Backup
   metadata:
     name: mybackup
     namespace: demo
   spec:
     backupMethod: xtrabackup
     backupPolicyName: mycluster-mysql-backup-policy
   EOF
   ```

    - `backupMethod: xtrabackup` indicates weâ€™re using the **xtrabackup** tool.
    - `backupPolicyName: mycluster-mysql-backup-policy` references the default MySQL backup policy.

2. **Apply the Backup**: (This is already done inline above via a multi-line `kubectl apply -f - ...`.)

3. **Monitor the Backup**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n demo --watch
   ```

   You may see a short-lived **backup job** or a Pod that performs the actual backup.

4. **Verify the Backup**:
    - Check the `Backup` status:

      ```bash
      kubectl get backup -n demo
      kubectl describe backup mybackup -n demo
      ```

    - List backups associated with `mycluster` using `kbcli`:

      ```bash
      kbcli cluster list-backups mycluster -n demo
      ```

   The backup artifact (data) should now reside in the configured **BackupRepo** (e.g., an S3 bucket or a PVC).

### 3.3 Validating the Backup

- **Check Logs or KubeBlocks UI** (if available) to confirm the backup was created successfully.
- Optionally, run:
  ```bash
  kbcli backup list -n demo
  ```
  to see all **Backup** resources in the `demo` namespace.

---

## 4. Restoring from a Backup

### 4.1 Restore Workflow Overview

**KubeBlocks** supports two typical restore scenarios:

1. **Overwrite an existing cluster**: For immediate disaster recovery.
2. **Create a new cluster**: Spin up a cloned environment for testing, QA, or analytics.

Under the hood, the KubeBlocks operator orchestrates the restore by **retrieving the backup data** from the specified **BackupRepo** and **re-seeding** the target MySQL cluster.

### 4.2 Preparing the Restore

To restore from a previously created backup (e.g., `mybackup`), we need to either:
- Use an **OpsRequest** of type `Restore`, or
- Use the `kbcli cluster restore ...` command, which creates the relevant resources on your behalf.

Youâ€™ll typically specify:
- **backupRef**: Which backup to restore from.
- **target cluster**: Where to restore the data.

### 4.3 Executing the Restore

Hereâ€™s a simple example using **`kbcli`**:

```bash
kbcli cluster restore myrestore --backup mybackup -n demo
```

This command instructs KubeBlocks to create a new cluster named `myrestore` from the `mybackup`. Alternatively, you can restore directly over your existing `mycluster` if thatâ€™s your intended scenario (though itâ€™s generally safer to restore into a fresh cluster for testing first).

1. **Apply the Restore Resource**: The command above automatically generates the needed restore specs.
2. **Monitor the Restore Process**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n demo --watch
   ```

   Youâ€™ll see new Pods (e.g., `myrestore-mysql-0`, etc.) come online and begin synchronization.

3. **Validate the New/Recovered Cluster**:
    - Ensure each Pod transitions to `Running` and `Ready`.
    - (Optional) Connect to MySQL and verify data:

      ```bash
      kubectl -n demo exec -it myrestore-mysql-0 -- \
        mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -e "SELECT @@version;"
      ```

### 4.4 Pitfalls & Considerations

- **Downtime**: If you choose to overwrite an existing cluster, expect downtime. Restoring into a fresh cluster can mitigate downtime for production.
- **Primary/Secondary Role Reassignments**: The operator will handle internal MySQL role transitions automatically.
- **Best Practices**:
    - **Test your backups regularly** to ensure they are valid and restorable.
    - **Schedule backups** (e.g., daily or weekly) for critical production workloads. (See below for a reference link.)

---

## 5. Understanding the Backup & Restore Lifecycle

### 5.1 Data Consistency & Snapshot Mechanisms

KubeBlocks ensures **transaction-consistent** backups by:
- Integrating with MySQLâ€™s **xtrabackup** tool, which performs online hot backups.
- Or using **volume snapshots** if your underlying storage supports it (logical or physical snapshots).

Both approaches aim to capture a consistent data state without significant downtime.

### 5.2 Operatorâ€™s Role

- The **KubeBlocks Operator** orchestrates container states during backup and restore.
- It manages underlying **volume snapshots** (if using the volume-snapshot method).
- It updates the clusterâ€™s status resources, letting you monitor progress in real time.
- **Minimal manual intervention** is required once your backup policies and repos are set.

## Optional Appendices

### Appendix A: Troubleshooting

- **Backup Not Starting**: Check if the `BackupRepo` is properly configured and accessible.
- **Restore Stuck**: Confirm the storage used by the new (or overwritten) cluster is sufficient and that the relevant Pods arenâ€™t in a crash loop.

### Appendix B: Custom Storage Backends

- **S3 / GCS / OSS / COS / OBS**: Configure credentials and endpoints in the `BackupRepo` resource.
- **MinIO** (S3-compatible): Ideal for on-prem or dev setups.
- **PVC**: For local, on-Kubernetes storage (not recommended for cross-region DR).
