Welcome to the **second chapter** of our **KubeBlocks** tutorial series!

In this guide, we will focus on **seamless upgrades** and **basic maintenance**â€”two core features that showcase KubeBlocksâ€™ ability to run **any database** at **Operator Capability Level 5**, suitable for **production-grade** operations. Whether youâ€™re managing a small dev cluster or a large-scale enterprise environment, KubeBlocks streamlines the entire database lifecycle on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

To save you time, weâ€™ve **automatically installed KubeBlocks** and created a **3-replica MySQL cluster** in the background. It may take a few minutes to complete the setupâ€”feel free to proceed, but keep in mind that some commands might need to wait until the installation is fully finished.

If youâ€™re new to KubeBlocks or missed the first tutorial, see:

## 1. Introduction & Review

### 1.1. Checking Your MySQL Cluster

By default, a **3-replica** MySQL cluster named `mycluster` has been created in the `demo` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo
```

Example output:

```
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mycluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   0          16s
mycluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running   0          16s
mycluster-mysql-2   4/4     Running   0          16s
```

### 1.2. High Availability Demonstration

KubeBlocks automatically configures one of these Pods as the **primary** database instance, while the rest act as **secondaries**. To see which is which, run:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -o yaml | grep kubeblocks.io/role
```

You may see something like:

```
kubeblocks.io/role: secondary
kubeblocks.io/role: primary
kubeblocks.io/role: secondary
```

In this example, `mycluster-mysql-1` is the **primary**, but keep in mind the actual Pod name assigned as primary in your environment could be different (e.g., `mycluster-mysql-0` or `mycluster-mysql-2`).

To illustrate KubeBlocksâ€™ built-in **High Availability (HA)**, try **removing the primary Pod**:

```bash
kubectl delete pod mycluster-mysql-1 -n demo
```

Shortly after deletion, KubeBlocks will:

1. **Promote** one of the secondaries to become the new primary.
2. **Restart** the removed Pod (e.g., `mycluster-mysql-1`).
3. **Maintain** data consistency across replicas throughout the process.

When you run `kubectl get pods -n demo` again, youâ€™ll see that the removed Pod is **recreated** and that a **new primary** has been automatically elected. No manual intervention is needed, and **no data is lost**. This seamless recovery demonstrates why KubeBlocks is ideal for production-grade environments where minimal downtime is crucial.

## 2. Upgrade a Cluster

Upgrading your database version is a key maintenance task. KubeBlocks orchestrates a **rolling upgrade**â€”updating pods one at a time to keep your database highly available throughout the process.

### 2.1 View Available MySQL Versions

Before starting an upgrade, **check which MySQL versions** KubeBlocks can deploy:

```bash
kubectl get clusterversion | grep mysql
```

Example output (your environment may differ):

```
Warning: The ClusterVersion CRD has been deprecated since 0.9.0
ac-mysql-8.0.30      apecloud-mysql       Available   2m55s
ac-mysql-8.0.30-1    apecloud-mysql       Available   2m55s
mysql-5.7.44         mysql                Available   2m56s
mysql-8.0.33         mysql                Available   2m56s
mysql-8.4.2          mysql                Available   2m56s
```

### 2.2 Performing a Rolling Upgrade

Letâ€™s say you want to upgrade from `mysql-8.0.33` to **`mysql-8.4.2`**. KubeBlocks will:

1. **Patch** the `Cluster` resource to request the new version.
2. **Sequentially** take each secondary offline, upgrade it, bring it back up, and then move on.
3. **Upgrade** the primary last, typically with a secondary promoted temporarily if necessary to avoid downtime.

**1\. Patch the cluster**:

```bash
kubectl patch cluster mycluster -n demo --type merge -p '
{
  "spec": {
    "clusterVersionRef": "mysql-8.4.2"
  }
}'
```

This instructs KubeBlocks to begin upgrading the `mycluster` to `mysql-8.4.2`.

**2\. Monitor the rolling update**:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo
```

You should see the Pods being updated one by one.

**2\. Validate** that the cluster remains operational:

- **Check Pod Status**: Ensure each Pod transitions through `Running` and `Ready` states in a sequence.
- **Confirm New Version**: Once all Pods have been upgraded, you can connect to MySQL and run:
```bash
kubectl -n demo exec -it mycluster-mysql-0 -- bash -c 'mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -e "SELECT @@version;"'
```
to ensure that the reported version matches `8.4.2`.

If everything goes smoothly, youâ€™ve completed a **seamless rolling upgrade** with minimal or zero downtime. Your applications should remain connected throughout.
