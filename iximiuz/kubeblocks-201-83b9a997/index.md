Welcome to the **second chapter** of our **KubeBlocks** tutorial series!

In this guide, we focus on **seamless upgrades**â€”a key feature that aligns with **Operator Capability Level 2**. Youâ€™ll see how KubeBlocks keeps your databases updated **with minimal downtime**, even in a production-grade environment. Whether youâ€™re managing a small dev cluster or a large-scale enterprise deployment, KubeBlocks streamlines the entire **database lifecycle** on Kubernetes, and can scale up to even more advanced capabilities.

## Prerequisites

To save you time, weâ€™ve **automatically installed KubeBlocks** and created a **3-replica MySQL cluster** in the background. It may take a few minutes to complete the setupâ€”feel free to proceed, but keep in mind that some commands might need to wait until the installation is fully finished.

If youâ€™re new to KubeBlocks or missed the first tutorial, see:
[Kubeblocks Tutorial 101 â€“ Getting Started](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/kubeblocks-101-99db8bca)

## 1. Introduction & Review

### 1.1. Checking Your MySQL Cluster

By default, a **3-replica** MySQL cluster named `mycluster` has been created in the `demo` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo
```

Example output:

```
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mycluster-mysql-0   4/4     Running   0          16s
mycluster-mysql-1   4/4     Running   0          16s
mycluster-mysql-2   4/4     Running   0          16s
```

### 1.2. High Availability Demonstration

KubeBlocks automatically configures one of these Pods as the **primary** database instance, while the rest act as **secondaries**. To see which is which, run:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -o yaml | grep kubeblocks.io/role
```

You may see something like:

```
kubeblocks.io/role: secondary
kubeblocks.io/role: primary
kubeblocks.io/role: secondary
```

In this example, `mycluster-mysql-1` is the **primary**, but keep in mind the actual Pod name assigned as primary in your environment could be different (e.g., `mycluster-mysql-0` or `mycluster-mysql-2`).

To illustrate KubeBlocksâ€™ built-in **High Availability (HA)**, try **removing the primary Pod**:

```bash
kubectl delete pod mycluster-mysql-1 -n demo
```

Shortly after deletion, KubeBlocks will:

1. **Promote** one of the secondaries to become the new primary.
2. **Restart** the removed Pod (e.g., `mycluster-mysql-1`).
3. **Maintain** data consistency across replicas throughout the process.

When you run `kubectl get pods -n demo` again, youâ€™ll see that the removed Pod is **recreated** and that a **new primary** has been automatically elected. No manual intervention is needed, and **no data is lost**. This seamless recovery demonstrates why KubeBlocks is ideal for production-grade environments where minimal downtime is crucial.

---

## 2. Upgrade a Cluster

Upgrading your database version is a key maintenance task. KubeBlocks orchestrates a **rolling upgrade**â€”updating pods one at a time to keep your database highly available throughout the process.

### 2.1 View Available MySQL Versions

Before starting an upgrade, **check which MySQL versions** KubeBlocks can deploy:

```bash
kubectl get clusterversion | grep mysql
```

Example output (your environment may differ):

```
Warning: The ClusterVersion CRD has been deprecated since 0.9.0
ac-mysql-8.0.30      apecloud-mysql       Available   2m55s
ac-mysql-8.0.30-1    apecloud-mysql       Available   2m55s
mysql-5.7.44         mysql                Available   2m56s
mysql-8.0.33         mysql                Available   2m56s
mysql-8.4.2          mysql                Available   2m56s
```

### 2.2 Performing a Rolling Upgrade

Letâ€™s say you want to upgrade from `mysql-8.0.33` to **`mysql-8.4.2`**. KubeBlocks will:

1. **Create a OpsRequest** to instruct `KubeBlocks Operator` to upgrade the cluster.
2. **Sequentially** take each secondary offline, upgrade it, bring it back up, and then move on.
3. **Upgrade** the primary last, typically with a secondary promoted temporarily if necessary to avoid downtime.

**1\. Patch the cluster**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: mysql-upgrade
  namespace: demo
spec:
  clusterRef: mycluster
  type: Upgrade 
  upgrade:
    clusterVersionRef: mysql-8.4.2
EOF
```

This instructs KubeBlocks to begin upgrading the `mycluster` to `mysql-8.4.2`.

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_cluster_upgrade
---
#active
Waiting for the MySQL Cluster to be upgraded to version `mysql-8.4.2`...

#completed
Yay! Your MySQL cluster has been successfully upgraded to version `mysql-8.4.2`. ðŸŽ‰
::

**2\. Monitor the rolling update**:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo
```

You should see the Pods being updated one by one.

**2\. Validate** that the cluster remains operational:

- **Check Pod Status**: Ensure each Pod transitions through `Running` and `Ready` states in a sequence.
- **Confirm New Version**: Once all Pods have been upgraded, you can connect to MySQL and run:
```bash
kubectl -n demo exec -it mycluster-mysql-0 -- bash -c 'mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -e "SELECT @@version;"'
```
to ensure that the reported version matches `8.4.2`.

If everything goes smoothly, youâ€™ve completed a **seamless rolling upgrade** with minimal or zero downtime. Your applications should remain connected throughout.

### 2.3 Understanding the Rolling Upgrade Process

During the rolling upgrade, KubeBlocks follows a carefully orchestrated sequence:

::image-box
---
src: __static__/mysql-upgrade-process-c.png
alt: 'Operator Capability Level'
---
::

1. **Initial State**: mysql-2 serves as Primary, with mysql-0 and mysql-1 as Secondaries.
2. **Secondary Upgrades**:
    - First upgrades mysql-0 (Secondary)
    - Then upgrades mysql-1 (Secondary)
3. **Primary Switch**:
    - Promotes mysql-0 to become the new Primary
4. **Final Upgrade**:
    - Upgrades the original Primary (mysql-2)
    - mysql-2 becomes a Secondary in the new configuration

This careful sequencing ensures:
- Minimal downtime during the upgrade
- Data consistency throughout the process
- Automatic handling of Primary/Secondary roles
- Safe rollback capability if issues occur
